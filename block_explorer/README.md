# Quickstart
```
npm i
npm start
```
Navigate to `localhost:3000`.  

# Info

This is a basic front-end block explorer. 
It requires a web3 object on window to work e.g. through metamask. 

When started it will asynchrnonously fetch blocks and transactions via web3. This may stress the browser till its done. 
It'll calculate the value of blocks, and fetch associated transactions. 
You can view transactions that have any value, and all transactions with value in a details popover. 
Furthermore you can get transaction details from a subsequent popover. 

# Bugs/ todo
Using popovers I think was a decent choice but theres a couple of bugs with the underlying modal component we use for it. 
- it doesnt scroll window to its position when openened e.g. if we click to open a modal after scrolling down a long list of tx
- if we close one modal, it closes all open modals. 
  
A loading screen might make sense since currently the app re-draws quite visibly.   

All values are in wei which is not very human readable. 

## Testing
Testing needs more work, more components tested etc
Currently only a BlockTxValue sum component is tested and that the whole app renders. 

# Create React app documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
